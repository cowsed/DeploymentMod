# Meeting Summaries
## 7/X/24
- Hey, nat and i are talking about a secret module, wanna join


## 7/17/24:
- High level wiring diagram
- What chips we need
- Minimum requirements for setting off deployment charges
- Planning DND (Damian and Nat's Deployment)
- Planning standalone powermod
- Setup Github
- Began CONOPs (ConOps, CONOPs)

## 7/24/24:

- Established polynomial fit is like almost it for predicting apogee :( - Pretty close
## 7/31/24
- Imported Flash chip sheet to Altium
- STMCube Document (in github ðŸ–¤)
- We can sort of measure drag so we can add that to our model
- Maybe fitting drag curve can yield apogee?
- Matlab model shows that drag creates a fairly predictible error rate in under estimating altitude, more modeling needed
- What defines a good model
  - At halfway point, predicted apogee should be within 300ft of actual

- Nat: is busy
- forgor abt mach effects
  - Detect Burnout, Detect Out of Mach/big buffer, then we're chilling again
- Bezier Curve Fitting??
- Accepting Defeat?:
  - We can prolly just get away with parabolas
  - s: current time, t: time of apogee
  - as s approaches t, your prediction gets better - drag plays less of a role, youre more of a parabola
  - if your prediction is good enough and your predicted apogee near enough, you can make the call telling any peripherals that its almost apogee time with some degree of certainty
  - now you just gotta implement least squares effeciently :)

Experiment Results: Sucess
- I was tricked into coming to the meeting

- Damian worked on slides, reqs etc
- Debouncing signals
- STLink pain (connecting to the STM32 itself), STM32 work, and wanting to murder the STM people
  - Like, connecting and making sure all the pins across the sheets are connected to the right stm32 pin
- car ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6b6b40c-ccec-4145-a8ea-38dd262ed631)


## 9/11/24
- damian died
- Its now called Brainsor mod
- We're a real team :tada:
- Gotta re spec
  -  steal backplane plane power / cut standalone power
  -  make sandwich plane requirements -> tell peeps to make sandwich plane 
  -  steal brain board continuity detection circuits
  -  new stm32?? [big bois](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32h7-series.html)
    - external osciallator scary
  -  damian wants doom on the module
-  Figure out a date for the presentation
-  
### Little Plane Requirements
- Power circuitry
  - Input:
    - 2S-3S (whatever powermod take)
  - Output:
    - the backplane power stuff
      - logic level
      - deployment signal level
- Backplane Compatible Pinout (just supplies power)
- **NO ETHERNET NEEDED** (no one to talk to :( )

## 9/18/24
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fadb820e-406b-4a87-8654-8c24849cf780)

- Magnetometers are wierd
- do strange things to i2c busses. surely nothing bad will happen
- The Opps got damian
- How do we want to do accelerometer
  - we fw the adxl375 in conjunction with the lsm6dsm
- What Processor :crab: no more vocore :crab:
  - wizzy or integrated ethernet?
  - both??????? 0ohm resitor bridge so we can have two implementations to double our chances of it working? is that gonna screw up ethernet (our track record with ethernet isn't good)
  - STM32H745/755 or STM32H747/757 (dual core models)
  - dont need them graphics, 747/757
  - dont need crypto/hash, 747
  - BI, XI, ZI (diff packages)
  - LQFP is cooler 

### Things to bring up  
- what kinda little plane?
  - do we give you reqs, or do we get reqs passed down from on high
  - power only littleplane, littleplane that just connects this to power mod
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19a9c33a-22a7-4ca8-9798-2b8c99d6fe15)
  - w h a t i s h a p p e n n i n g
- what package do we rock with?
  -

## 10/30/24
Oh shit we have no memes no wonder we're struggling.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e463deb1-cd10-4cbc-9254-f9e56a168f48)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb1306d3-d183-4b6f-b9aa-cc00d4136a8a)

Thigns to do:

- Richie
  - Altimeter ground level calibration (find pressure at ground level at start, make AGL from that)
  - Make IMU 9.81 m/s calibrated
