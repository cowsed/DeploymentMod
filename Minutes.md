- Established polynomial fit is like almost it for predicting apogee :( - Pretty close
## 7/31/24
- Imported Flash chip sheet to Altium
- STMCube Document (in github ðŸ–¤)
- We can sort of measure drag so we can add that to our model
- Maybe fitting drag curve can yield apogee?
- Matlab model shows that drag creates a fairly predictible error rate in under estimating altitude, more modeling needed
